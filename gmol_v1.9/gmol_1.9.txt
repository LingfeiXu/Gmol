Bug fixed: stuck resulted from scaledown at fiber level
new features:
1. A lower level (below fiber level); 
The level only contains one double-helix string and it is the same whatever which unit you choose.
This level is the nucleosome core particle(ncp) level, which each ncp consists of approximately 147 base pairs of DNA.

2. Now user can generate the exon and intron parts of a given DNA sequence based on the information given by UCSC knownGene.txt
User can color and label the transcription start position and coding region parts on the sequence.
